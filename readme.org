* Ansible Recipes
** Version tested

Written for ansible 1.8

** Target (Server in need of configuration)

Install Debian 8 into virtual box (name: debian8)

Login as root
: ssh root@<target ip>

Install sudo
: apt-get update
: apt-get install sudo

Add a deploy user & set a password
: adduser deploy

Add your user to the 'sudo' group within /etc/group
: sudo:x:27:deploy

Don't ask for a password when using sudo, *risky* (optional)
Note: This is optional if you are using the -b then there is no need for this.
/etc/sudoers
: %sudo   ALL = NOPASSWD: ALL
: %sudo   ALL= (postgres) NOPASSWD: ALL

** Source (Your development box)

Ansible 1.8 (currently the HEAD branch when you clone).
: sudo apt-get install python-yaml python-jinja2 python-paramiko
: git clone https://github.com/ansible/ansible.git
: cd ansible
: git submodule update --init --recursive
: sudo make install 
(Make sure you do not have any other ansible installed through your systems package manager).

Clone this repo (ansible-recipes)
: git clone https://github.com/map7/ansible_recipes.git

Install the roles
: sudo ansible-galaxy install Heroqu.nodejs4x
: sudo ansible-galaxy install mtpereira.passenger

Add target's IP to /etc/ansible/hosts file under the top ungrouped section
EG:
: 192.168.0.100

Create passwordless access (server to client)
: ssh-copy-id deploy@<target ip>


** Running

Now you can run with this command (on the development machine)

: ansible-playbook media_center.yml -b -v
| -b | become sudo |
| -v | verbose     |

*NOTE* With mysql I leave the password blank for the root user until I've finished setup, then manually assign a new password using the following;
: mysqladmin -u root password 'newpassword'

** Custom variables

Create your custom variables in vars/custom.yml (this is ignored in the repository)
Place it at the bottom of your vars list to override the defaults I've set.


** Check environment variables

: ansible <target ip> -m setup

** Available configurations

| media_center | Installs XBMC with LTSP (fat-clients) |
| ltsp_thin    | Thin client server                    |
| ltsp_fat     | Fat client server                     |
| webserver    | Ruby on Rails server                  |
** DONE Update to 1.9

- [X] [[https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/CHANGELOG.md][Look at changes from 1.2 to 1.5 and optimise]]
