* Ansible Recipes
** Version tested

Written for ansible 1.2

** Source (Your development box)

Ansible 1.2
: sudo apt-get install python-yaml python-jinja2 python-paramiko
: git clone https://github.com/ansible/ansible.git
: cd ansible
: sudo make install 
(Make sure you do not have any other ansible installed through your systems package manager).

Ansible 1.1
Install on my desktop Ubuntu system (not the server you are trying to configure).
: sudo apt-add-repository ppa:rquillo/ansible
: sudo apt-get update                        
: sudo apt-get install ansible               

Add target's IP to /etc/ansible/hosts file under the top ungrouped section
EG:
: 192.168.0.100

** Target (Server in need of configuration)

Install Debian 7 into virtual box (name: debian7)

Create passwordless access (server to client)
: ssh-copy-id <user>@<target ip>

Add your user to the 'sudo' group within /etc/groups

Don't ask for a password when using sudo, *risky*
/etc/sudoers
: %sudo   ALL = NOPASSWD: ALL

** Running
Now you can run with this command (on the server)
: ansible-playbook media_center.yml -K -v
| -K | ask for sudo password |
| -v | verbose               |

** Custom variables

Create your custom variables in vars/custom.yml (this is ignored in the repository)
Place it at the bottom of your vars list to override the defaults I've set.


** Check environment variables

: ansible <target ip> -m setup

** Available configurations

| media_center | Installs XBMC with LTSP (fat-clients) |
| ltsp_thin    | Thin client server                    |
| ltsp_fat     | Fat client server                     |
| webserver    | Ruby on Rails server                  |
