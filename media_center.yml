# Media center
#
# This builds a media center using XBMC & LTSP. At the end you should have the following
# - Main server with XBMC and lots of software for work, rest and play
# - Fat clients booting from the main server with XBMC and some software for basic browsing/email.
#
- hosts: xbmc
  user: map7
  sudo: yes
  vars:
    main_user: xbmc
    password: $1$SomeSalt$nbQMcEVhuIZWc9xDaQOs70
  vars_files:
    - "vars/defaults.yml"
    - "vars/$ansible_distribution-$ansible_architecture.yml"
    - "vars/$ansible_distribution.yml"


  # Tasks for XBMC are put in a specific order
  tasks:
    # Add xbmc user
    - name: Add $main_user user
      user: name=$main_user password=$password groups='epoptes,sudo,vboxusers' shell=/bin/bash

    # Autologin
    - name: Set Automatic login
      lineinfile:
