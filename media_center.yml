# Media center
#
# This builds a media center using XBMC & LTSP. At the end you should have the following
# - Main server with XBMC and lots of software for work, rest and play
# - Fat clients booting from the main server with XBMC & some software for basic browsing/email.
#
- hosts: xbmc
  user: map7
  sudo: yes

    main_user: xbmc
